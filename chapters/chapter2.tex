\section{Existing System Study}

\subsection{For Research/Product based Projects}

Do a literature survey and identify five most suitable base papers that align with your project. Select the top journal/conference paper which are recent in the area, which has addressed this problem. For each of those papers, write a
paragraph that subsumes, Contributions of the paper: (A short paragraph of less than 50 words) , Limitations of the paper : (A short paragraph of less than 50 words) , Open Problems/Future work possible: (Enumerate the list) 

Review existing products, tools, or technologies solving similar problems.
Include market comparisons or feature analysis.

\section{Research Gap/ Scope for improvement and innovation}

Limitations/ problems not addressed in existing systems Point out the specific shortcomings or challenges that persist in existing solutions.Identify areas or research questions that have not been addressed
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Which are all the gaps that you have addressed now in the Phase I
    \item Gaps which you plan to address in phase II( If the project is to be continued)
\end{enumerate}


\section{Problem Statement and Contributions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Problem Statement: Clearly articulate the specific challenge you aim to solve. Ensure it flows naturally from the gaps identified in the previous slide. Use precise, concise language to define the problem scope.
    \item  Research Contributions Present 2â€“4 clear, measurable research contribution of your work. For Research Projects: Focus on advancing knowledge, developing methodologies, or validating hypotheses. For Product-Based Projects: Focus on delivering a functional, innovative solution with specific features or improvements.
\end{enumerate}
