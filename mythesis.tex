\chapter*{Abstract}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract} 

 India is an agricultural country, as two-thirds of its population is engaged in agricultural activities, the development in this sector is very important for the country both economically and socially.  The losses in agriculture due to pests and diseases are estimated to be approximately 20-25\%. Despite the significance of the agricultural sector for the country, the application and implementation of Artificial intelligence and machine learning have been limited in the past five years. We must introduce cutting-edge technologies in Artificial intelligence to the agricultural sector to improve the quality of life of farmers and other people in the sector. This project introduces a solution to diagnose the common pests and diseases in plants using Artificial intelligence and Machine learning techniques. The study focuses on implementing a robust solution to classify different plant diseases based on the images mainly focused on the leaves. The project proposes a Vision Transformer(ViT)-based solution with an accuracy of 99 per cent on the test dataset for diagnosis of fourteen different plant diseases across three different crops. The lack of introduction of these technologies can also be interpreted as the consequence absence of good, clean and homogeneous data for training different models. To help the future development of similar solutions the project summarizes the current state of the various famous datasets for usage in production-level solutions development. As the solutions developed are highly dependent on the availability and quality of existing datasets, we propose a clean and efficient way to collect and organize more data for further development. The project also implements and tests how these solutions can be efficiently deployed and made accessible to everyone. The project starts out with an essential focus on the differentiation of the chilli plants that are infected by the leaf curl virus form the healthy ones to eventually generalize the problem of plant disease diagnosis.  Large Language Models(LLM's) are the current trend in making data more accessible to everyone. The project also engineers a solution to introduce the LLM's to make the user more knowledgeable about the disease at hand and also guide him in the process of minimizing the loss due to the pest or disease.
